The bloc, for financial and strategic reasons, wants to build strong economic ties with Beijing that bolster Brussels' desire to be a serious player on the world stage as the leading light of Western values.The problem is, doing so in any serious way means turning a blind eye to China's well-documented human rights violations.For much of the past decade, the world's largest trading bloc has gone out of its way to establish an economic partnership with Beijing that doesn't conflict too aggressively with Brussels' lofty values. The EU was criticized from both in and outside the bloc when it announced last December the conclusion in principle of negotiations with the Chinese government on its \\\"Comprehensive Agreement on Investment\\\" (CAI).  According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the agreement, if ratified, \\\"will provide unprecedented access to the Chinese market,\\\" while also committing \\\"China to ambitious principles on sustainability, transparency and non-discrimination.\\\" Any agreement like this needs to be approved by the EU's 27 member states and ratified by the European parliament.  Read MorePrecisely how bound China would be to any of the EU's redlines was an immediate cause for concern. \\\"The deal makes statements about human rights and forced labor, but there is no way of forcing China to do anything,\\\" says Samira Rafaela, a member of the EU parliament who sits on the international trade committee.Queen Elizabeth visits UK's largest warship, as it set sails for South China SeaMany of Rafaela's colleagues across the political spectrum clearly agree. Last week, the parliament voted on a motion to freeze the CAI until further notice. Ostensibly, this was in protest at China placing sanctions on five MEPs who had criticized China's treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang among other things.  However, in reality the sanctions were really the final straw for some who couldn't stomach Brussels striking a friendly deal with a government in Beijing that allegedly imprisons people in forced labor camps, undermines democracy in Hong Kong and is increasingly hostile in its own region.  \\\"The statement we are sending with this motion isn't simply, if China lifts the sanctions then CAI is back on the table,\\\" says Reinhard B\\u00fctikofer, chair of the parliament's delegation on China relations. \\\"If sanctions are lifted, we will look at the detail, but it's currently far from satisfactory. It's weak on forced labor, weak on sustainability, weak on dispute resolutions. These problems will still exist even if we resurrect the agreement.\\\"  Given the chances of China lifting these sanctions any time soon is virtually zero, this creates a problem for the top brass in the EU Commission, who have invested a lot of political capital in the deal.   For the EU's increasingly political executive branch, China formed a key part of its plan to become a bigger player on the global stage and become diplomatically independent of its most important ally: the United States. \\\"Strategic autonomy,\\\" as Brussels calls it, has been a priority for EU officials who are concerned about Europe's inherent vulnerabilities, be they from Russian aggression in the east, over-reliance on China for medical supplies or the risk of another president like Donald Trump pulling American troops out of Europe.  \\\"The China agreement was a big plank in that strategy,\\\" says Steven Blockmans, director of research at the Centre for European Policy Studies. \\\"If the Chinese and European parliament don't move, the EU risks losing a deal that would have cemented the idea it can make decisions to defend its own commercial interests, without having to call the White House first.\\\" Despite the European parliament's protests, the commission still thinks the deal is right for the EU. Officials who spoke with CNN explained that they understood the parliament's concerns and that the political conditions didn't exist at the moment. One official even lauded the parliament's action, saying it provided proof that \\\"economic interests will not prevent the EU from standing up for human rights.\\\" However, they also said this was a rare window of opportunity to get China committing to something on paper, and that window could run out for political reasons -- most notably after upcoming elections in France and Germany, the two member states most supportive of the deal.  It's at member state level that the apparent split between parliament and commission gets interesting. It's been known for some time that locking in some kind of formal relationship with China was a big priority for Angela Merkel as she tries to nail down her legacy. The German Chancellor will stand down after 16 years in power this autumn, as Germany holds federal elections.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (R) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel attend a joint news conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on May 24, 2018. As things stand, it's likely that Merkel's party -- no longer with a leader who holds as much political capital as her -- will have to enter a coalition with the anti-Beijing Greens. This could significantly soften German support for the deal.  The other key sponsor of the deal was French President Emmanuel Macron, a man who also faces re-election next year. The fact that Macron's biggest rival is far-right Marine Le Pen has led some to think he might, in the coming months, cool on globalist policies.  As for the other member states, diplomats who spoke to CNN pointed out that the CAI is not a full trade deal and that there was no urgent need to rush anything through. As one diplomat put it, \\\"there is an awakening in Europe about the real character of its relationship with China and governments don't like it. This will be parked for a while is my guess.\\\" The commission remains convinced that its political capital was well spent and that member states will ultimately choose their economies over other priorities. \\\"Even if leadership changes, the economic reality in Germany and France isn't going to change, and economics has a habit of trumping other concerns,\\\" the diplomat said.   Philippe Lamberts, a senior Belgian MEP, disagrees: \\\"I think EU-China relations are going to get worse before they get better. Even if they lift their sanctions, what message does it send on European values if we agree a deal with such weak provisions on human rights, democracy and sustainability?\\\"  The EU's record on human rights, critics argue, is already patchy. While last week the European parliament did stand up to both China and Turkey -- calling for the suspension of talks with Ankara to join the bloc over its own human rights record -- campaigners say that the EU is not doing enough to uphold its own standards on human records inside or outside the bloc.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and French Emmanuel Macron (taste wine as they visit France's pavilion during the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on November 5, 2019.\\\"Trade and investment are an area where economic interests have always prevailed over respect for human rights, as much as security concerns have always prevailed in migration management,\\\" says Elena Crespi, program officer for Western Europe at the International Federation for Human Rights.  And while the parliament has a good track record on human rights, awarding its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to an imprisoned Uyghur scholar in 2019, critics believe the commission falls short in comparison.  \\\"The current commission is not sufficiently doing its job in upholding European values,\\\" says Alice Stollmeyer, executive director of Defend Democracy. \\\"Whether it's fudging on rule of law in Hungary and Poland or failing to properly speak out against atrocities elsewhere, the EU sadly seems to have a policy of appeasement for abusers.\\\" It's no secret that the EU is in a transitional phase. Those at the center of the project see a future of closer union and its officials in Brussels becoming serious players on the world stage in their own right.  If a balanced relationship with China was indeed central to this, the current mood among elected politicians across the member states will be of serious concern to the Brussels elite.  Perhaps more worrying, Blockmans points out, is whether China reassesses how much it wants a deal with the bloc. \\\"It might be that China still sees the EU as a secondary player -- a lackey to the US. If that's that case, they might decide that this is a deal worth collapsing for their own political ends.\\\"  Regardless, the point is moot while Europe's political class refuses to even look at this deal. The longer this deadlock on sanctions goes on, the greater the chance it totally collapses. And it if does, those at the top table in Brussels might regret investing so much political capital in dealing with one of the world's worst human rights offenders.  \",\n          \" (CNN)Senegal and Liverpool football star Sadio Mane has donated $693,000 (\\u00a3500,000) to help fund the construction of a hospital in his hometown of Bambali in Senegal.

The biggest similarity was the high number of named storms. The 2021 season became only the third in history to use all of the names on the rotating seasonal list (the previous years were 2020 and 2005).We ended the season with 21 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). During an average year there would be 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. This year met or exceeded each of those categories, and it was forecast to be that way. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30.There were four major hurricanes this season: Grace, Ida, Larry, and Sam. The strongest two were Ida and Sam, which both reached Category 4 strength. Grace and Larry peaked as Category 3 storms. The first half of the season was off to the races -- as the US was impacted by eight named storms: Claudette, Danny, Elsa, Fred, Henri, Ida, Mindy, and Nicholas.Read MoreThen, suddenly, the world's oceans became eerily quiet. After September 25 the Atlantic and the rest of the world would struggle to produce a named storm.That was not what meteorologists expected.\\\"The globe has had no major (Category 3+, max winds >=111 mph) hurricane/typhoon/cyclone formations since September 25. All other hurricane seasons in the satellite era (since 1966) have had at least two global major hurricane formations between September 26 - November 19,\\\" Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University, said in a tweet.  Both last year and this year La Ni\\u00f1a conditions were observed during the last several weeks of the season, which typically favors late season tropical activity. 2020 saw three named storms in November (Eta, Theta, and Iota) and 2021 saw just one (Wanda) during the first few days.How this hurricane season ended marks one of the biggest differences between this year and last.Klotzbach explained that usually La Ni\\u00f1a weakens or limits vertical wind shear, but surprisingly there was quite elevated wind shear in the Caribbean in October and November -- the focal region for storms late in the season -- and that led to a quiet latter part of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.NOAA predicts 6th consecutive above-average hurricane seasonWhile an active season was predicted, it's impossible to know in advance exactly where each storm will go and what kind of damage it may cause. A \\\"bad\\\" season is all about perspective. Central American countries may consider this to have been a \\\"good\\\" year since not a single named storm hit any part of the region. In 2020, Central America was hit by three named storms, two of which were major hurricanes. In the US, the state of Louisiana can't seem to catch a break. In 2020, the Pelican State was impacted by five named storms: Cristobal, Laura, Marco, Delta and Zeta. This year the state was impacted by three named storms: Claudette, Ida and Nicholas.In 2020 more hurricanes made landfall in the US, but this year the storms cost over $20 billion more. Billions in damageWhile only one major hurricane made landfall across the US (Ida), a total of four named storms left behind over $1 billion in damage each: Tropical Storm Elsa, Tropical Storm Fred, Hurricane Ida, and Hurricane Nicholas.Ida alone exceeded the cost in damage of all seven billion-dollar tropical cyclones that made landfall across the US in 2020, including hurricanes like Laura, Delta, and Zeta.\\\"To date, Hurricane Ida is the costliest disaster this year -- exceeding $60 billion,\\\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \\\"Ida already ranks among the top-five most costly hurricanes on record for the US since 1980.\\\"JUST WATCHEDThis Louisiana family lost their mom in Hurricane Ida.

Typically, storms during this month form over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, western Caribbean Sea and near the southeastern US coast.Another unique storm was Subtropical Storm Teresa. Reports of subtropical storms are not uncommon, especially in the 21st century, thanks to advanced technology. What is uncommon is for a storm to remain subtropical for its entire life, never transitioning to \\\"tropical\\\" status. Teresa was also extremely short-lived, at only 24 hours. Subtropical Storm Teresa formed on Friday, September 24, at 5 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time. Exactly 24 hours later, the NHC issued its final advisory as Teresa became a remnant, low-pressure system. Ida will likely be the only name on the retired list this year, despite there being three other major hurricanes, simply because of the amount of damage and fatalities caused.

e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

A \"Flying-V\" plane designed by Delft's University of Technology in the Netherlands and Dutch airline KLM can cut fuel consumption by 20%. Ultimately, researchers hope to switch out the kerosene with a sustainable fuel source, like liquid hydrogen.Hide Caption 7 of 13 Photos: Hydrogen aviation could provide a sustainable solution for short and medium-haul flights. In September, Airbus unveiled plans for three hydrogen-powered, zero-emission aircraft which can carry 100 to 200 passengers.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n","1

mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.  Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n","2

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n","\n","

the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one Among them is San Diego based TuSimple Founded in 2015 TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US China and Europe Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers Navistar in the US and Traton Volkswagen s trucking business in Europe to design and

Oklahoma City The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work 11 hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile Today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said Read A robotic Ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to Lu By focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said Lu TuSimple s autonomous fleet Instead TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving Take Phoenix to El Paso that s a six hour drive A person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours But the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery They get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said Lu No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 Lu says that 7 000 have been reserved in the US alone Photos The robots running our warehouses Photos The robots running our warehousesRobots are an

working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like US companies Plus and Embark Grayson Brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte Co believes TuSimple is on the right track The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking They re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks These are different skills and different systems altogether he said Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night In the US every year there are about 5 000 fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said Lu The truck doesn t get tired doesn t watch a movie or look at a phone It doesn t get distracted   \n","1

 CNN Working in a factory or warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over and that repetition can lead to chronic injury Now a battery powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain The Ironhand glove strengthens the wearer s grip meaning they don t have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks Its developer Bioservo says it can increase the wearer s hand strength by 20 The Swedish company describes the system as a soft exoskeleton Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body typically increasing strength and endurance Most have a rigid structure but the Ironhand is soft like a regular glove Photos The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses At the south east London

in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses Each Ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor NASA developed an early version of the technology called Robo Glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors GM to develop the glove for its workers Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says Stephen Krajcarski a senior manager with GM s ergonomics team By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into According to market research firm ABI Research the exoskeleton market will grow from 392 million in 2020 to 6 8 billion in 2030 If you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says Krajcarski But this is an exciting technology This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system   \n","2

no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded said Eric Winograd senior economist at AllianceBernstein Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero Trading shares of several leading US listed Russian companies such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS have been halted And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25 the day after the invasion Russia could default on its debt within days The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal Winograd said Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets it s not clear what comes next Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds With indexes starting to exclude Russia it s still a wait and see game said Mychal Campos head of investing at Betterment For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets Winograd said each country should be looked at individually The name of the game will be differentiation Don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym Winograd said It s always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing for example They re not Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST To stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS and that could be a permanent change said Rahul Sen Sharma managing partner with Indxx a global index provider Will investors ever embrace Russia again If there is no liquidity it s a moot point But it s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon Sen Sharma told CNN Business Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia such as Taiwan and South Korea The BRICS could become the TICKS He added that Poland Turkey and Mexico are intriguing as are the Philippines and Indonesia You could dub Mexico Indonesia South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets People love their acronyms Sen Sharma joked Of course any emerging market in Europe think Poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks It s a piece of a portfolio said Callie Cox US investment analyst at eToro The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile Cox added noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its

of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n","      <td>CNN Right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around \\u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \\\"Robo-Glove,\\\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\\\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\\\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\\\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\\\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\\\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\\\" says Krajcarski. \\\"But this is an exciting technology.\\\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.\",\n          \"New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\\\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\\\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \\\"zero\\\" or \\\"effectively zero.\\\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted.

One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\\\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\\\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \\\"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\\\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \\\"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\\\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \\\"virtual railroads,\\\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \\\"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\\\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \\\"middle mile,\\\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \\\"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\\\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \\\"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\\\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \\\"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks.

The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \\\"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\\\" said Lu. \\\"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone.

needed when lifting objects says Mikael Wester Bioservo s marketing director It s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses Each Ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor NASA developed an early version of the technology called Robo Glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors GM to develop the glove for its workers Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says Stephen Krajcarski a senior manager with GM s ergonomics team By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into According to market research firm ABI Research the exoskeleton market will grow from 392 million in 2020 to 6 8 billion in 2030 If you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says Krajcarski But this is an exciting technology This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system \",\n          \"New York CNN Business For many years the world s most popular emerging markets have been the so called BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded said Eric Winograd senior economist at AllianceBernstein Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero Trading shares of several leading US listed Russian companies such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS have been halted And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25 the day after the invasion Russia could default on its debt within days The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal Winograd said Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets it s not clear what comes next Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds With indexes starting to exclude Russia it s still a wait and see game said Mychal Campos head of investing at Betterment For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets Winograd said each country should be looked at individually The name of the game will be differentiation Don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym Winograd said It s always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing for example They re not Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST To stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS and that could be a permanent change said Rahul Sen Sharma managing partner with Indxx a global index provider Will investors ever embrace Russia again If there is no liquidity it s a moot point But it s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon Sen Sharma told CNN Business Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia such as Taiwan and South Korea The BRICS could become the TICKS He added that Poland Turkey and Mexico are intriguing as are the Philippines and Indonesia You could dub Mexico Indonesia South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets People love their acronyms Sen Sharma joked Of course any emerging market in Europe think Poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks It s a piece of a portfolio said Callie Cox US investment analyst at eToro The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile Cox added noting that

worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one Among them is San Diego based TuSimple Founded in 2015 TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US China and Europe Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers Navistar in the US and Traton Volkswagen s trucking business in Europe

from Nogales Arizona to Oklahoma City The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from Tucson to Dallas the truck drove itself Read More Today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said Cheng Lu TuSimple s president and CEO The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep In the US a driver can only work 11 hours a day We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said Lu That of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once TuSimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch Unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available TuSimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software We collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said Lu As a result TuSimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which Lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company in the US 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 Its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads Happier drivers The technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 According to Lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver If you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile But you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average US wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile Today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said Read A robotic Ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to Lu By focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said Lu TuSimple s autonomous fleet Instead TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving Take Phoenix to El Paso that s a six hour drive A person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours But the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery They get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said Lu No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 Lu says that 7 000 have been reserved in the US alone Photos The robots running our warehouses Photos The

backed Aurora but those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like US companies Plus and Embark Grayson Brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte Co believes TuSimple is on the right track The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking They re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks These are different skills and different systems altogether he said Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night In the US every year there are about 5 000 fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error

e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n","1

mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.  Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n","2

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n","\n","

oklahoma city the pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from tucson to dallas the truck drove itself read more today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said cheng lu tusimple s president and ceo the journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep in the us a driver can only work 11 hours a day we simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said lu that of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once tusimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard picking up the watermelons still required the human touch unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available tusimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software we collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route that adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said lu as a result tusimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else this swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksaccording to the company in the us 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business tusimple is currently mapping routes between arizona and texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads happier drivers the technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year the results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 lu says that 7 000 have been reserved in the us alone photos the robots running our warehouses photos the robots running our warehousesrobots are an

working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars tusimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like us companies plus and embark grayson brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm brulte co believes tusimple is on the right track the biggest competitive advantage that tusimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking they re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks these are different skills and different systems altogether he said removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits the company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night in the us every year there are about 5 000 fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said lu the truck doesn t get tired doesn

 cnn working in a factory or warehouse can mean doing the same task over and over and that repetition can lead to chronic injury now a battery powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain the ironhand glove strengthens the wearer s grip meaning they don t have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks its developer bioservo says it can increase the wearer s hand

in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run the ironhand system was developed with general motors as a partner read morethe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove there are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object a remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses each ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 the device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries according to the european agency for safety and health at work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product from nasa to general motors the glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor nasa developed an early version of the technology called robo glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space the ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer general motors gm to develop the glove for its workers why online supermarket ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says stephen krajcarski a senior manager with gm s ergonomics team by using tools such as the ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator krajcarski says gm has helped bioservo to test and improve the ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants he says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations the ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons gm is looking into according to market research firm abi research the exoskeleton market will grow from 392 million in 2020 to 6 8 billion in 2030 if you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says krajcarski but this is an exciting technology this story has been updated to correct the cost of the ironhand system   \n","2

no longer a market that westerners can access following the invasion of ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together the brics had their day in the sun and that has faded said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein several major us index providers have removed russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero trading shares of several leading us listed russian companies such as search engine yandex and telecom mts have been halted and the moscow stock exchange has been closed since february 25 the day after the invasion russia could default on its debt within days the idea that a country as large as russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal winograd said read moreit seems likely that russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon even for those westerners still willing to invest in russian assets it s not clear what comes next some investors are asking about exposure to russia in emerging markets funds with indexes starting to exclude russia it s still a wait and see game said mychal campos head of investing at betterment for investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets winograd said each country should be looked at individually the name of the game will be differentiation don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym winograd said it s always strange to say that argentina and south korea are the same thing for example they re not forget the brics and look at ticks or mist to stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the russian stock market has essentially turned the brics into the bics and that could be a permanent change said rahul sen sharma managing partner with indxx a global index provider will investors ever embrace russia again if there is no liquidity it s a moot point but it s also hard to believe that people will rush into russia anytime soon sen sharma told cnn business sen sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace russia such as taiwan and south korea the brics could become the ticks he added that poland turkey and mexico are intriguing as are the philippines and indonesia you could dub mexico indonesia south korea and turkey the mist markets people love their acronyms sen sharma joked of course any emerging market in europe think poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to russia and ukraine so other central and eastern european nations may be a hard sell for western investors war in ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsother experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves a typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks it s a piece of a

of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n","      <td>cnn right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the us and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic one solution to

roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year the results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 lu says that 7 000 have been

cars tusimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like us companies plus and embark grayson brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm brulte co believes tusimple is on the right track the biggest competitive advantage that tusimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking they re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks these are different skills and different systems altogether he said removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits the company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night in the us

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around \\u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \\\"Robo-Glove,\\\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\\\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\\\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\\\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\\\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\\\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\\\" says Krajcarski. \\\"But this is an exciting technology.\\\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.\",\n          \"New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\\\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\\\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \\\"zero\\\" or \\\"effectively zero.\\\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted.

One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\\\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\\\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \\\"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\\\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \\\"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\\\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \\\"virtual railroads,\\\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \\\"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\\\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \\\"middle mile,\\\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \\\"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\\\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \\\"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\\\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \\\"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks.

The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \\\"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\\\" said Lu. \\\"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone.

needed when lifting objects says mikael wester bioservo s marketing director it s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run the ironhand system was developed with general motors as a partner read morethe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove there are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object a remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses each ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 the device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries according to the european agency for safety and health at work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product from nasa to general motors the glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor nasa developed an early version of the technology called robo glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space the ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer general motors gm to develop the glove for its workers why online supermarket ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says stephen krajcarski a senior manager with gm s ergonomics team by using tools such as the ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator krajcarski says gm has helped bioservo to test and improve the ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants he says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations the ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons gm is looking into according to market research firm abi research the exoskeleton market will grow from 392 million in 2020 to 6 8 billion in 2030 if you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says krajcarski but this is an exciting technology this story has been

china and south africa but given that russia is no longer a market that westerners can access following the invasion of ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together the brics had their day in the sun and that has faded said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein several major us index providers have removed russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero trading shares of several leading us listed russian companies such as search engine yandex and telecom mts have been halted and the moscow stock exchange has been closed since february 25 the day after the invasion russia could default on its debt within days the idea that a country as large as russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal winograd said read moreit seems likely that russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon even for those westerners still willing to invest in russian assets it s not clear what comes next some investors are asking about exposure to russia in emerging markets funds with indexes starting to exclude russia it s still a wait and see game said mychal campos head of investing at betterment for investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets winograd said each country should be looked at individually the name of the game will be differentiation don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym winograd said it s always strange to say that argentina and south korea are the same thing for example they re not forget the brics and look at ticks or mist to stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the russian stock market has essentially turned the brics into the bics and that could be a permanent change said rahul sen sharma managing partner with indxx a global index provider will investors ever embrace russia again if there is no liquidity it s a moot point but it s also hard to believe that people will rush into russia anytime soon sen sharma told cnn business sen sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace russia such as taiwan and south korea the brics could become the ticks he added that poland turkey and mexico are intriguing as are the philippines and indonesia you could dub mexico indonesia south korea and turkey the mist markets people love their acronyms sen sharma joked of course any emerging market in europe think poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to russia and ukraine so other central and eastern european nations may be a hard sell for western investors war in ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsother experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves a typical investor

from nogales arizona to oklahoma city the pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from tucson to dallas the truck drove itself read more today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said cheng lu tusimple s president and ceo the journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep in the us a driver can only work 11 hours a day we simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said lu that of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once tusimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard picking up the watermelons still required the human touch unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available tusimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software we collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route that adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said lu as a result tusimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else this swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksaccording to the company in the us 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business tusimple is currently mapping routes between arizona and texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads happier drivers the technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year the results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 lu says that 7 000 have been reserved in the us alone photos the robots running our warehouses photos the

backed aurora but those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars tusimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like us companies plus and embark grayson brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm brulte co believes tusimple is on the right track the biggest competitive advantage that tusimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking they re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks these are different skills and different systems altogether he said removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits the company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night in the us every year there are about 5 000 fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error

e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"    \n","1

mean doing the same task over and over, and that repetition can lead to chronic injury. Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The \"Ironhand\" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a \"soft exoskeleton.\" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.  Photos: The robots running our warehousesRobots are an increasingly familiar presence in warehouses. At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesSeven-foot \"Model-T\" robots produced by Japanese startup Telexistence have been stacking shelves in two of Tokyo's largest convenience store franchises. Featuring cameras, microphones and sensors, the Model-T uses three \"fingers\" to stock items such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls. The robot is controlled by shop staff remotely.Hide Caption 3 of 8 Photos: The robots running our warehousesUS company Boston Dynamics has become known for its advanced work robots. \"Handle\" is made for the warehouse and equipped with an on-board vision system. It can lift boxes weighing over 30 pounds.

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.   \n","2

They're not just working hard, they're working smart; as they operate, they get better at their job.The Autonomous Mobile Robots were developed by Chinese startup Geek+. As they move around the warehouse they're guided by QR codes on the floor, and using AI they are able to make their own decisions, including what direction to travel and what route to take to their destination.

At the south-east London warehouse run by British online supermarket Ocado, 3,000 robots fulfill shopping orders. When an order is sent to the warehouse, the bots spring to life and head towards the container they require.

China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \"zero\" or \"effectively zero.\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days\"The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,\" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.\"Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,\" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.\"The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,\" Winograd said. \"It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not.\" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. \"Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,\" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. \"People love their acronyms,\" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\"A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It's a piece of a portfolio,\" said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\"The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,\" Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. \"There has been more anxiety.\"   \n","\n","

e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic one solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one among them is san diego based tusimple

retrofitted with its technology tusimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers navistar in the us and traton volkswagen s trucking business in europe to design and

oklahoma city the pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from tucson to dallas the truck drove itself read more today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said cheng lu tusimple s president and ceo the journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep in the us a driver can only work 11 hours a day we simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said lu that of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once tusimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard picking up the watermelons still required the human touch unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available tusimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software we collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route that adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said lu as a result tusimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else this swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksaccording to the company in the us 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business tusimple is currently mapping routes between arizona and texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads happier drivers the technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year the results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 lu says that 7 000 have been reserved in the us alone photos the robots running our warehouses photos the robots running our warehousesrobots are an

consulting firm brulte co believes tusimple is on the right track the biggest competitive advantage that tusimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking they re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks these are different skills and different systems altogether he said removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits the company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night in the us every year there are about 5 000 fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said lu the truck doesn t get tired doesn t watch a movie or look at a phone it doesn t get distracted  \n","1

in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run the ironhand system was developed with general motors as a partner read morethe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove there are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object a remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses each ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 the device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries according to the european agency for safety and health at work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product from nasa to general motors the glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor nasa developed an early version of the technology called robo glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space the ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer general motors gm to develop the glove for its workers why online supermarket ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says stephen krajcarski a senior manager with gm s ergonomics team by using tools such as the ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator krajcarski says gm has helped bioservo to test and improve the ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants he says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations the ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons gm is looking into according to market research firm abi research the exoskeleton market will grow from 392 million in 2020 to 6 8 billion in 2030 if you look at exoskeletons this is just

that has faded said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein several major us index providers have removed russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero trading shares of several leading us listed russian companies such as search engine yandex and telecom mts have been halted and the moscow stock exchange has been closed since february 25 the day after the invasion russia could default on its debt within days the idea that a country as large as russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal winograd said read moreit seems likely that russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon even for those westerners still willing to invest in russian assets it s not clear what comes next some investors are asking about exposure to russia in emerging markets funds with indexes starting to exclude russia it s still a wait and see game said mychal campos head of investing at betterment for investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets winograd said each country should be looked at individually the name of the game will be differentiation don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym winograd said it s always strange to say that argentina and south korea are the same thing for example they re not forget the brics and look at ticks or mist to stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the russian stock market has essentially turned the brics into the bics and that could be a permanent change said rahul sen sharma managing partner with indxx a global index provider will investors ever embrace russia again if there is no liquidity it s a moot point but it s also hard to believe that people will rush into russia anytime soon sen sharma told cnn business sen sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace russia such as taiwan and south korea the brics could become the ticks he added that poland turkey and mexico are intriguing as are the philippines and indonesia you could dub mexico indonesia south korea and turkey the mist markets people love their acronyms sen sharma joked of course any emerging market in europe think poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to russia and ukraine so other central and eastern european nations may be a hard sell for western investors war in ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsother experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves a typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks it s a piece of a

of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte &amp; Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"</td>\n","      <td>cnn right now there s a shortage of truck drivers in the us and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic one solution to

roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year the results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 lu says that 7 000 have been

cars tusimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like us companies plus and embark grayson brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm brulte co believes tusimple is on the right track the biggest competitive advantage that tusimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking they re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks these are different skills and different systems altogether he said removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits the company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night in the us

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around \\u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \\\"Robo-Glove,\\\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\\\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\\\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\\\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\\\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\\\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\\\" says Krajcarski. \\\"But this is an exciting technology.\\\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.\",\n          \"New York (CNN Business)For many years, the world's most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.But given that Russia is no longer a market that Westerners can access following the invasion of Ukraine, it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together.\\\"The BRICS had their day in the sun and that has faded,\\\" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.Several major US index providers have removed Russian stocks from indexes at a price of \\\"zero\\\" or \\\"effectively zero.\\\" Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted.

One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\\\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\\\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \\\"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\\\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \\\"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\\\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \\\"virtual railroads,\\\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \\\"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\\\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \\\"middle mile,\\\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \\\"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\\\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \\\"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\\\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \\\"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\\\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \\\"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\\\" said Lu. \\\"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone.

needed when lifting objects says mikael wester bioservo s marketing director it s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run the ironhand system was developed with general motors as a partner read morethe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove there are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object a remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses each ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 the device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries according to the european agency for safety and health at work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product from nasa to general motors the glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor nasa developed an early version of the technology called robo glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space the ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer general motors gm to develop the glove for its workers why online supermarket ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says stephen krajcarski a senior manager with gm s ergonomics team by using tools such as the ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator krajcarski says gm has helped bioservo to test and improve the ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants he says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations the ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons gm is looking into according to market research firm abi research the exoskeleton market will grow from 392 million in 2020 to 6 8 billion in 2030 if you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says krajcarski but this is an exciting technology this story has been

china and south africa but given that russia is no longer a market that westerners can access following the invasion of ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together the brics had their day in the sun and that has faded said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein several major us index providers have removed russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero trading shares of several leading us listed russian companies such as search engine yandex and telecom mts have been halted and the moscow stock exchange has been closed since february 25 the day after the invasion russia could default on its debt within days the idea that a country as large as russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal winograd said read moreit seems likely that russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon even for those westerners still willing to invest in russian assets it s not clear what comes next some investors are asking about exposure to russia in emerging markets funds with indexes starting to exclude russia it s still a wait and see game said mychal campos head of investing at betterment for investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets winograd said each country should be looked at individually the name of the game will be differentiation don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym winograd said it s always strange to say that argentina and south korea are the same thing for example they re not forget the brics and look at ticks or mist to stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the russian stock market has essentially turned the brics into the bics and that could be a permanent change said rahul sen sharma managing partner with indxx a global index provider will investors ever embrace russia again if there is no liquidity it s a moot point but it s also hard to believe that people will rush into russia anytime soon sen sharma told cnn business sen sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace russia such as taiwan and south korea the brics could become the ticks he added that poland turkey and mexico are intriguing as are the philippines and indonesia you could dub mexico indonesia south korea and turkey the mist markets people love their acronyms sen sharma joked of course any emerging market in europe think poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to russia and ukraine so other central and eastern european nations may be a hard sell for western investors

from nogales arizona to oklahoma city the pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from tucson to dallas the truck drove itself read more today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said cheng lu tusimple s president and ceo the journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep in the us a driver can only work 11 hours a day we simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said lu that of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once tusimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard picking up the watermelons still required the human touch unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available tusimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software we collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route that adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said lu as a result tusimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else this swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksaccording to the company in the us 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business tusimple is currently mapping routes between arizona and texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads happier drivers the technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year the results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 lu says that 7 000 have been reserved in the us alone photos the robots running our warehouses photos the

backed aurora but those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars tusimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like us companies plus and embark grayson brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm brulte co believes tusimple is on the right track the biggest competitive advantage that tusimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking they re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks these are different skills and different systems altogether he said removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits the company says its

there s a shortage of truck drivers in the us and worldwide exacerbated by the e commerce boom brought on by the pandemic one solution to the problem is autonomous trucks and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one among them is san diego based tusimple founded in 2015 tusimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the us china and europe although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology tusimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers navistar in the us

involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles from nogales arizona to oklahoma city the pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from tucson to dallas the truck drove itself read more today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said cheng lu tusimple s president and ceo the journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep in the us a driver can only work 11 hours a day we simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said lu that of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once tusimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard picking up the watermelons still required the human touch unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available tusimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software we collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route that adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said lu as a result tusimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else this swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksaccording to the company in the us 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business tusimple is currently mapping routes between arizona and texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads happier drivers the technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year the results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024 lu says that 7 000 have been reserved in the us alone photos the

competitors such as google spinoff waymo and uber backed aurora but those are working on a wider range of self driving vehicles including passenger cars tusimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks like us companies plus and embark grayson brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm brulte co believes tusimple is on the right track the biggest competitive advantage that tusimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking they re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks these are different skills and different systems altogether he said removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits the company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers and can see farther down the road even at night in the us every year there are about 5 000 fatalities involving trucks and most are due to human error said lu the truck doesn t get tired doesn t watch a movie or look at a phone it doesn t get distracted   \n","1

chronic injury now a battery powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain the ironhand glove strengthens the wearer s grip meaning they don t have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks its developer bioservo says it can increase the wearer s hand strength by 20 the swedish company describes the system as a soft exoskeleton exoskeletons are an external device

lifting objects says mikael wester bioservo s marketing director it s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run the ironhand system was developed with general motors as a partner read morethe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove there are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object a remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses each ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 the device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries according to the european agency for safety and health at work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product from nasa to general motors the glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor nasa developed an early version of the technology called robo glove to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space the ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer general motors gm to develop the glove for its workers why online supermarket ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says stephen krajcarski a senior manager with gm s ergonomics team by using tools such as the ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator krajcarski says gm has helped bioservo to test and improve the ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants he says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations the ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons gm is looking into according to market research firm abi research the exoskeleton market will grow from 392 million in 2020 to 6 8 billion in 2030 if you look at exoskeletons this is just one of the tools that are out there says krajcarski but this is an exciting technology this story has been updated to correct the cost of the

china and south africa but given that russia is no longer a market that westerners can access following the invasion of ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together the brics had their day in the sun and that has faded said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein several major us index providers have removed russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero trading shares of several leading us listed russian companies such as search engine yandex and telecom mts have been halted and the moscow stock exchange has been closed since february 25 the day after the invasion russia could default on its debt within days the idea that a country as large as russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal winograd

business sen sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace russia such as taiwan and south korea the brics could become the ticks he added that poland turkey and mexico are intriguing as are the philippines and indonesia you could dub mexico indonesia south korea and turkey the mist markets people love their acronyms sen sharma joked of course any emerging market in europe think poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to russia and ukraine so other central and eastern european nations may be a hard sell for western investors war in ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsother experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves a typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks it s a piece of a portfolio said callie cox us investment analyst at etoro the emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile cox added noting that

completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the us china and europe although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology tusimple has deals in place with two of the world s largest truck manufacturers navistar in the us and traton volkswagen s trucking business in europe to design and build fully autonomous models which

were handled by a human driver but for the bulk of the route from tucson to dallas the truck drove itself read more today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said cheng lu tusimple s president and ceo the journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep in the us a driver can only work 11 hours a day we simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said lu that of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once tusimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard picking up the watermelons still required the human touch unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available tusimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software we collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route that adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said lu as a result tusimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else this swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksaccording to the company in the us 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business tusimple is currently mapping routes between arizona and texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads happier drivers the technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver in the cabin at all before the end of the year the results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own

director it s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run the ironhand system was developed with general motors as a partner read morethe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove there are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object a remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses each ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 the device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries according to the european agency for safety and health at work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product from nasa to general motors the glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor nasa developed an early version of the technology called robo glove

auto manufacturer general motors gm to develop the glove for its workers why online supermarket ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says stephen krajcarski a senior manager with gm s ergonomics team by using tools such as the ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator krajcarski says gm has helped bioservo to test and improve the ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants he says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations the ironhand is just one of

director it s all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run the ironhand system was developed with general motors as a partner read morethe system consists of a backpack which houses the power pack and artificial tendons that connect to the glove there are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object a remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses each ironhand system costs around 6 000 7 275 the device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer s risk of developing strain injuries according to the european agency for safety and health at work work related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in europe costing national economies up to 2 of their gross national product from nasa to general motors the glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor nasa developed an early version of the technology called robo glove

jobs to the workers instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job says stephen krajcarski a senior manager with gm s ergonomics team by using tools such as the ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator krajcarski says gm has helped bioservo to test and improve the ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants he says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it s not suitable for all situations the ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons gm is looking into according to market research firm abi research the exoskeleton market will grow from 392 million in 2020 to 6 8 billion in 2030 if you look at exoskeletons this is

for many years the world s most popular emerging markets have been the so called brics brazil russia india china and south africa but given that russia is no longer a market that westerners can access following the invasion of ukraine it might be time for investors to stop lumping all of the emerging markets together the brics had their day in the sun and that has faded said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein several major us index providers have removed russian stocks from indexes at a price of zero or effectively zero trading shares of several leading us listed russian companies such as search engine yandex and telecom mts have been halted and the moscow stock exchange has been closed since february 25 the day after the invasion russia could default on its debt within days the idea that a country as large as russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal winograd said read moreit seems likely that russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon even for those westerners still willing to invest in russian assets it s not clear what comes next some investors are asking about exposure to russia in emerging markets funds with indexes starting to exclude russia it s still a wait and see game said mychal campos head of investing at betterment for investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets winograd said each country should be looked at individually the name of the game will be differentiation don t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym winograd said it s always strange to say that argentina and south korea are the same thing for example they re not forget the brics and look at ticks or mist to stick with the acronyms the shutdown of the russian stock market has essentially turned the brics into the bics and that could be a permanent change said rahul sen sharma managing partner with indxx a global index provider will investors ever embrace russia again if there is no liquidity it s a moot point but it s also hard to believe that people will rush into russia anytime soon sen sharma told cnn business sen sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace russia such as taiwan and south korea the brics could become the ticks he added that poland turkey and mexico are intriguing as are the philippines and indonesia you could dub mexico indonesia south korea and turkey the mist markets people love their acronyms sen sharma joked of course any emerging market in europe think poland is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to russia and ukraine so other central and eastern european nations may be a hard sell for western investors war in ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsother experts argue that investors are

the route from tucson to dallas the truck drove itself read more today because the system is not fully ready we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we re testing but we drove in full autonomy the driver wasn t touching the wheel said cheng lu tusimple s president and ceo the journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver mostly because a truck doesn t need to sleep in the us a driver can only work 11 hours a day we simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation said lu that of course negates the advantage of an autonomous system so the idea is that once tusimple s trucks hit the market there will be no need to have anyone onboard picking up the watermelons still required the human touch unlike self driving cars which are a still a way from being commercially available tusimple trucks won t be required to operate in bustling city traffic but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company s own software we collect data from the roads and we create this very detailed high definition map of each route that adds another layer of safety for the vehicles said lu as a result tusimple s trucks will only be able to self drive along these pre mapped trade corridors which lu calls virtual railroads and nowhere else this swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksaccording to the company in the us 80 of goods travel through just 10 of the nation s trade corridors so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business tusimple is currently mapping routes between arizona and texas and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024 its plans are dependent on state legislation however because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads happier drivers the technology will add about 50 000 to the cost of a truck making the final price roughly 200 000 according to lu that s still cheaper than paying for a human driver if you take 50 000 and divide it by 1 million miles the average lifespan of a truck that means you re adding five cents per mile but you re saving the cost of a human driver which based on average us wages is about 80 000 to 120 000 per year or 80 cents to 1 20 per mile today the direct labor cost is about 50 of the cost of operating a truck he said read a robotic ironhand could protect factory workers from injuriesthat doesn t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs according to lu by focusing on the middle mile rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods tusimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers while at the same time protecting existing jobs a ups driver is dropping off 200 packages a day that s not what autonomy is meant for we believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver even if they enter the workforce today said lu tusimple s autonomous fleet instead tusimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers which involve long stretches of monotonous driving take phoenix to el paso that s a six hour drive a person cannot make the round trip because it s more than 11 hours but the truck can go back and forth all day the most mundane job that drivers don t want to do that means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile pickup and delivery they get to work a full day which is a more efficient use of their time and they get to go home at night to their family said lu no distractions although lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased tusimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests without a human safety driver

exclusively on driverless trucks like us companies plus and embark grayson brulte an autonomy expert at consulting firm brulte co believes tusimple is on the right track the biggest competitive advantage that tusimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose built for trucking they re not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class 8 trucks these are different skills and different systems altogether he said removing the human

invasion of Ukraine, one thing is certain: No one knows exactly how things will play out. So far that disturbing uncertainty hasn't sent markets into a sustained tailspin. US stocks took a hit the week of the invasion, but have since recovered some of those losses. But the market is likely to experience volatility as events unfold. \"It's hard to call this one,\" said Florida-based certified financial planner Mari Adam. \"We just don't know.\"But if you've been concerned about whether the geopolitical turmoil might negatively affect your savings and investments, here are a few ways to assess your situation and guard against potential losses.Don't trade on the headlines Read MoreRapid-fire news reports about soaring energy and food prices or talk of a potential world war or nuclear attack are unnerving. Oil price shocks cause recessions. Will this one do the same?But history often shows that making financial decisions based on an emotional response to major events is often a losing proposition long term.\"Making a radical change in the midst of all this uncertainty is usually a decision that [you'll] regret,\" said Don Bennyhoff, chief investment officer for Liberty Wealth Advisors and a former investment strategist at Vanguard.Look back at periods of war and other crises in the last century and you'll see that stocks typically came back faster than anyone might have expected in the moment, and did well on average over time.For example, since the financial crisis hit in 2008,  the S&P 500 returned 11% a year on average through 2021, according to data analyzed by First Trust Advisors. The worst year in that period was 2008, when stocks fell 38%. But in most of the years that followed, the index posted a gain. And four of its annual gains ranged between 23% and 30%.If you go back as far as 1926, that annual average return on the S&P has been 10.5%.  \"Staying the course may be hard on your nerves, but it can be healthiest for your portfolio,\" said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income and wealth management at Charles Schwab.That's not to discount the seriousness of nuclear threats and the chance that this period could diverge from historical patterns. But were things to truly escalate globally, Williams noted, \"we'd have more to be concerned about than our investment portfolios.\"Instead of making changes based on your reaction to the latest events, first review your financial situation holistically.Cover your near-term cash needsIt's always a good idea, but especially when confronted with big events beyond your control, to make sure you have liquid assets for your most urgent needs.That means enough money set aside in cash, money market funds or short-term fixed income instruments to cover near-term tax payments, unexpected emergencies and any big, upcoming expenses (e.g., a down payment or tuition). This is also advisable if you are near or in retirement, in which case you may want to have enough liquidity to cover a year or more of the living expenses that you would ordinarily pay for with withdrawals from your portfolio, Williams said. This should be the amount you would need to supplement your fixed income payments, such as Social Security or a private pension. In addition, Williams suggests having two to four years in lower volatility investments like a short-term bond fund. That will help you ride out any market downturn should one occur and give your investments time to recover.Review your risk toleranceIt's easy to say you have a high tolerance for risk when the S&P 500 keeps setting record highs. But you have to be able to stomach the volatility that inevitably comes with investing  over time.So review your holdings to make sure they still align with your risk tolerance for a potentially rockier road ahead. And while you're at it, figure out what it means to you to \"lose\" money. \"There are many definitions of risk and loss,\" Bennyhoff said. What is a financial coach and who really needs one?For instance, if you're keeping money in a savings account or CD, any interest rate you're earning is likely being outpaced by inflation. So while you preserve your principal, you lose buying power over time. Then again, if it's more important to preserve principal over a year or two than risk losing any of it -- which could happen when you invest in stocks -- that inflation-based loss may be worth it to you because you're getting what Bennyhoff calls a \"sleep-easy return.\"That said, for longer-term goals, figure out how much you feel comfortable putting at some risk to get a greater return and prevent inflation from eating away at your savings and gains.\"Over time you're better off and safer as a person if you can grow your wealth,\" Adam said.Rebalance your portfolioGiven record stock returns in the past few years, now may be a good time to rebalance your portfolio if you haven't done so in a while. For instance, Adam said, you may be overweight in growth stocks. To help stabilize your returns going forward, she suggested maybe reallocating some money into slower-growing, dividend-paying value stocks through a mutual fund.Make new investments slowlyIf you have a large lump sum -- maybe you just sold your business or house, or you got an inheritance or big bonus -- you may wonder what to do with it now.Given all the global uncertainty, Adam recommends investing it in smaller chunks periodically -- e.g., every month for a given period of time -- rather than all at once. \"Space out your investing over time since this week's news will be different than next week's news,\" she said.Reassess assumptionsIn the months leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the expectation was that the Federal Reserve would be hiking interest rates multiple times this year to curb high inflation. Now? Maybe not as much. \"The near-term effects on the US economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday. \"Given the current situation, we need to move carefully.\"That could push government bond prices higher and rates lower, should investors seek US Treasurys as a safe haven on a sustained basis. And it could mean that interest rates on savings may not move as high as they might have when everyone expected the Federal Reserve would hike rates substantially this year.Do your best. Then 'let go'Keep in mind: It's impossible to make perfect choices since no one has perfect information.\"Collect your facts. Try to make the best decision based on those facts plus your individual goals and risk tolerance.\" Adam said. Then, she added, \"Let go.\"(If you want to help Ukrainians who have had to flee or who stayed behind to fight, here's a growing list of organizations to which you can make a

       with russia s internationally condemned invasion of ukraine one thing is certain no one knows exactly how things will play out so far that disturbing uncertainty hasn t sent markets into a sustained tailspin us stocks took a hit the week of the invasion but have since recovered some of those losses but the market is likely to experience volatility as events unfold it s hard to call this one said florida based certified financial planner mari adam we just don t know but if you ve been concerned about whether the geopolitical turmoil might negatively affect your savings and investments here are a few ways to assess your situation and guard against potential losses don t trade on the headlines read morerapid fire news reports about soaring energy and food prices or talk of a potential world war or nuclear attack are unnerving oil price shocks cause recessions will this one do the same but history often shows that making financial decisions based on an emotional response to major events is often a losing proposition long term making a radical change in the midst of all this uncertainty is usually a decision that you ll regret said don bennyhoff chief investment officer for liberty wealth advisors and a former investment strategist at vanguard look back at periods of war and other crises in the last century and you ll see that stocks typically came back faster than anyone might have expected in the moment and did well on average over time for example since the financial crisis hit in 2008 the s p 500 returned 11 a year on average through 2021 according to data analyzed by first trust advisors the worst year in that period was 2008 when stocks fell 38 but in most of the years that followed the index posted a gain and four of its annual gains ranged between 23 and 30 if you go back as far as 1926 that annual average return on the s p has been 10 5 staying the course may be hard on your nerves but it can be healthiest for your portfolio said rob williams managing director of financial planning retirement income and wealth management at charles schwab that s not to discount the seriousness of nuclear threats and the chance that this period could diverge from historical patterns but were things to truly escalate globally williams noted we d have more to be concerned about than our investment portfolios instead of making changes based on your reaction to the latest events first review your financial situation holistically cover your near term cash needsit s always a good idea but especially when confronted with big events beyond your control to make sure you have liquid assets for your most urgent needs that means enough money set aside in cash money market funds or short term fixed income instruments to cover near term tax payments unexpected emergencies and any big upcoming expenses e g a down payment or tuition this is also advisable if you are near or in retirement in which case you may want to have enough liquidity to cover a year or more of the living expenses that you would ordinarily pay for with withdrawals from your portfolio williams said this should be the amount you would need to supplement your fixed income payments such as social security or a private pension in addition williams suggests having two to four years in lower volatility investments like a short term bond fund that will help you ride out any market downturn should one occur and give your investments time to recover review your risk toleranceit s easy to say you have a high tolerance for risk when the s p 500 keeps setting record highs but you have to be able to stomach the volatility that inevitably comes with investing over time so review your holdings to make sure they still align with your risk tolerance for a potentially rockier road ahead and while you re at it figure out what it means to you to lose money there are many definitions of risk and loss bennyhoff said what is a financial coach and who really needs one for instance if you re keeping money in a savings account or cd any interest rate you re earning is likely being outpaced by inflation so while you preserve your principal you lose buying power over time then again if it s more important to preserve principal over a year or two than risk losing any of it which could happen when you invest in stocks that inflation based loss may be worth it to you because you re getting what bennyhoff calls a sleep easy return that said for longer term goals figure out how much you feel comfortable putting at some risk to get a greater return and prevent inflation from eating away at your savings and gains over time you re better off and safer as a person if you can grow your wealth adam said rebalance your portfoliogiven record stock returns in the past few years now may be a good time to rebalance your portfolio if you haven t done so in a while for instance adam said you may be overweight in growth stocks to help stabilize

So far that disturbing uncertainty hasn't sent markets into a sustained tailspin. US stocks took a hit the week of the invasion, but have since recovered some of those losses. But the market is likely to experience volatility as events unfold. \"It's hard to call this one,\" said Florida-based certified financial planner Mari Adam. \"We just don't know.\"But if you've been concerned about whether the geopolitical turmoil might negatively affect your savings and investments, here are a few ways to assess your situation and guard against potential losses.Don't trade on the headlines Read MoreRapid-fire news reports about soaring energy and food prices or talk of a potential world war or nuclear attack are unnerving. Oil price shocks cause recessions. Will this one do the same?But history often shows that making financial decisions based on an emotional response to major events is often a losing proposition long term.\"Making a radical change in the midst of all this uncertainty is usually a decision that [you'll] regret,\" said Don Bennyhoff, chief investment officer for Liberty Wealth Advisors and a former investment strategist at Vanguard.Look back at periods of war and other crises in the last century and you'll see that stocks typically came back faster than anyone might have expected in the moment, and did well on average over time.For example, since the financial crisis hit in 2008,  the S&amp;P 500 returned 11% a year on average through 2021, according to data analyzed by First Trust Advisors. The worst year in that period was 2008, when stocks fell 38%. But in most of the years that followed, the index posted a gain. And four of its annual gains ranged between 23% and 30%.If you go back as far as 1926, that annual average return on the S&amp;P has been 10.5%.  \"Staying the course may be hard on your nerves, but it can be healthiest for your portfolio,\" said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income and wealth management at Charles Schwab.That's not to discount the seriousness of nuclear threats and the chance that this period could diverge from historical patterns. But were things to truly escalate globally, Williams noted, \"we'd have more to be concerned about than our investment portfolios.\"Instead of making changes based on your reaction to the latest events, first review your financial situation holistically.Cover your near-term cash needsIt's always a good idea, but especially when confronted with big events beyond your control, to make sure you have liquid assets for your most urgent needs.That means enough money set aside in cash, money market funds or short-term fixed income instruments to cover near-term tax payments, unexpected emergencies and any big, upcoming expenses (e.g., a down payment or tuition). This is also advisable if you are near or in retirement, in which case you may want to have enough liquidity to cover a year or more of the living expenses that you would ordinarily pay for with withdrawals from your portfolio, Williams said. This should be the amount you would need to supplement your fixed income payments, such as Social Security or a private pension. In addition, Williams suggests having two to four years in lower volatility investments like a short-term bond fund. That will help you ride out any market downturn should one occur and give your investments time to recover.Review your risk toleranceIt's easy to say you have a high tolerance for risk when the S&amp;P 500 keeps setting record highs. But you have to be able to stomach the volatility that inevitably comes with investing  over time.So review your holdings to make sure they still align with your risk tolerance for a potentially rockier road ahead. And while you're at it, figure out what it means to you to \"lose\" money. \"There are many definitions of risk and loss,\" Bennyhoff said. What is a financial coach and who really needs one?For instance, if you're keeping money in a savings account or CD, any interest rate you're earning is likely being outpaced by inflation. So while you preserve your principal, you lose buying power over time. Then again, if it's more important to preserve principal over a year or two than risk losing any of it -- which could happen when you invest in stocks -- that inflation-based loss may be worth it to you because you're getting what Bennyhoff calls a \"sleep-easy return.\"That said, for longer-term goals, figure out how much you feel comfortable putting at some risk to get a greater return and prevent inflation from eating away at your savings and gains.\"Over time you're better off and safer as a person if you can grow your wealth,\" Adam said.Rebalance your portfolioGiven record stock returns in the past few years, now may be a good time to rebalance your portfolio if you haven't done so in a while. For instance, Adam said, you may be overweight in growth stocks. To help stabilize your returns going forward, she suggested maybe reallocating some money into slower-growing, dividend-paying value stocks through a mutual fund.Make new investments slowlyIf you have a large lump sum -- maybe you just sold your business or house, or you got an inheritance or big bonus -- you may wonder what to do with it now.Given all the global uncertainty, Adam recommends investing it in smaller chunks periodically -- e.g., every month for a given period of time -- rather than all at once. \"Space out your investing over time since this week's news will be different than next week's news,\" she said.Reassess assumptionsIn the months leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the expectation was that the Federal Reserve would be hiking interest rates multiple times this year to curb high inflation. Now? Maybe not as much. \"The near-term effects on the US economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday. \"Given the current situation, we need to move carefully.\"That could push government bond prices higher and rates lower, should investors seek US Treasurys as a safe haven on a sustained basis. And it could mean that interest rates on savings may not move as high as they might have when everyone expected the Federal Reserve would hike rates substantially this year.Do your best. Then 'let go'Keep in mind: It's impossible to make perfect choices since no one has perfect information.\"Collect your facts. Try to make the best decision based on those facts plus your individual goals and risk tolerance.\" Adam said. Then, she added, \"Let go.\"(If you want to help Ukrainians who have had to flee or who stayed behind to fight, here's a growing list of organizations to which you can make a donation.)</td>\n","
